# _PyBer_Analysis Challenge_

With this analysis, I Created visualizations for a 2.3 billion dollar rideshare app company called PyBer. I used the data given to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. Also, I Created a summary data frame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I Analyzed the number of drivers, how many rides, and the average fare cost for urban, rural, and suburban areas.

### _Disparities_
The urban areas had the most amount of rides and drivers with the lowest cost per ride. Where as Rural areas had the least amount of drivers and rides but the fare prices were more costly. Suburban cities had a significantly lower number of drivers compared to the urban areas but not quite as low as the rural cities.
